# Vite Plugin SingleFile Example

This is a test app for [Vite Plugin SingleFile](https://github.com/richardtallent/vite-plugin-singlefile).

It uses a `file:` package reference for the plugin to allow local testing of changes
to the plugin, so to build this, so you need the plugin cloned to a sister folder in
order to build this app.
